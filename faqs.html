							<h3>FAQ Digital Marketing</h3>
							<ul class="accordion">
								<li class="accordion-item">
									<a class="accordion-title active" href="javascript:void(0)">What is digital Marketing?</a>
									<p class="accordion-content show">Digital marketing is all about marketing yourself or your product/service over the internet. Its basically a way of marketing using Internet-connected electronic devices like computers, smartphones and tablets. Digital marketing focuses on channels such as search engines, social media, email, websites and apps to connect with prospects and customers.</p>
								</li>
								
								<li class="accordion-item">
									<a class="accordion-title" href="javascript:void(0)">What kind of businesses benefit from digital marketing? Can i really gain something from it?</a>
									<p class="accordion-content">Most Definitely yes. Every company that offers goods or services can seriously benefit from digital marketing.Even though companies in many business categories tend to approach digital marketing with skepticism, avoiding digital marketing denies your business access to the media which the majority of consumers turn to first whenever they need help. The internet is a good platform to market your products or services because almost everyone this days spends all his/her time on social media.</p>
								</li>
								
								<li class="accordion-item">
									<a class="accordion-title" href="javascript:void(0)">Are SEO's really that important for my website? what is local SEO?</a>
									<p class="accordion-content">The majority of web traffic is generated by search and those that come by way of search have a greater degree of commercial intent than most other channels.A local SEO is the process of optimizing your online properties to generate traffic from location-based searches. It helps businesses promote products and services to local customers when they need them. </p>
								</li>
								
								<li class="accordion-item">
									<a class="accordion-title" href="javascript:void(0)">What determines search engine rankings?What are keywords?</a>
									<p class="accordion-content">This question is the source of endless speculation and debate because search engine companies such as Google will not answer it. Experts generally agree rankings are based on relevance and authority, but the factors that determine them are many—and inconsistent. The best way to achieve a high search engine ranking is to create one of the most thorough web pages possible for a specific keyword or topic.Keywords are the words and phrases searchers use—usually with search engines—to find relevant pages, images, videos, or any kind of information when looking for answers, knowledge, products, or services. SEO professionals consider keywords and the topics they suggest when optimizing content for search.</p>
								</li>
								
								<li class="accordion-item">
									<a class="accordion-title" href="javascript:void(0)">What is PPC?</a>
									<p class="accordion-content">PPC stands for pay-per-click. Essentially, it’s a way of buying web traffic. Advertisers pay a fee each time one of their ads is clicked. Search engine advertising is the most popular form of PPC, however numerous channels including Facebook now offer PPC ad models.</p>
								</li>
								
								<li class="accordion-item">
									<a class="accordion-title" href="javascript:void(0)">What does Google Analytics do for me?</a>
									<p class="accordion-content">Google Analytics is a free website analytics platform that gives you insights into how users find and use your website. With Google Analytics, you can track ROI for your online marketing and review important metrics to make informed decisions. The bulk of Google Analytics categorizes data into acquisition, behavior and conversions.</p>
